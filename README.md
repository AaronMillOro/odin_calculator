# Calculator

A simple calculator that contains functions for all of the basic math operators :
    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. It includes the logic that populates the display when you click the number buttons. The ‘display value’ is stored in the sessionStorage 

Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42. 

The calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. 

Pressing “clear” wipes out any existing data.

A snarky error message is shown if the user tries to divide by 0.
